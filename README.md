# Scribblez

## Intro

Welcome to Scribblez!

This code randomly generates a collection of standard shapes (circles, lines, etc) to create cartoon faces that look hand-drawn. The placement, shape, and size of the features are all randomized so each face is unique. You can save your favorite faces on your computer! This project is in conjunction with my NFT Scribblez Marketplace repo: https://github.com/pannicole/polygon-ethereum-nextjs-marketplace-1

## Setup

Now that you've got the code, follow these steps to run locally:

* `npm install`
* `createdb scribblez`
* `npm run start:dev`
